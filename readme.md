Instructions:

Create a brand new repository under your GitHub account. Give it a descriptive name such as "Week1-Day4", and a description such as "Week 1 day 4 - Function Prototyping".
Create a new HTML file named index.html.
Inside of the HTML file, create a simple HTML document. Add the following to the document:
A title, description and author metadata.
An HTML label with Name: as the text.
A textbox (an HTML input of type text) that has an id of name.
Create six more label/textboxes for the six monster/player statistics: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom, Intelligence and Charisma. Be sure to give the text boxes unique IDs as well.
A third label with Player Class (Optional).
A textbox with the id class.
A button with the text Add Player/Monster to Records and an the id addMonster.
Finally, add a table with eight columns, with the headers Name, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom, Intelligence, Charisma and Player Class (Optional).
Create a new CSS file named styles.css.
Add a reference to this file in index.html.
Add any styles you want to make this app look nicer. Look at W3 School's CSS Tables.
Create a new JavaScript file named app.js.
Add a reference to this file in index.html.
Create an object called Monster that has the properties name, strength, dexterity, constitution, wisdom, intelligence, and charisma.
Create an object called Player that inherits from Monster, and has the additional property playerClass.
Create a constructor for Player as well as a prototype to correctly pass reference to this.
Create an empty array to serve as storage.
Next, write an function that will act as a click handler for the button. It should call the appropriate constructor using the values the user typed into the textboxes, add the object to the array, append it to the table for visual representation, and clear out the textboxes. Hint: Use document.getElementById('addMonster').addEventListener('click', <functionNameGoesHere>);
Add a prototypical function to the Monster class called Attack. When called, it will roll a 20 sided die and add that to the object's strength value. Hint: return Math.floor(Math.random() * 20) + 1 added to the object's strength value. -For the player class override the function using prototypes to return the same thing, but use dexterity value instead of strength.
Make the player/monster's name a hyperlink or button, and when it is clicked it should output the value of Monster.Attack() or Player.Attack() to an alert or to the DOM. Use the array and the objects in the array, looking them up from the array using the name.

Bonus:

Instead of using a textbox for Player Class, try creating a radio button (HTML input of type radio) that has the values None, Cleric, Fighter, Rogue, and Wizard.
Change the application to use your favorite RPG's system, classes, add in other stats like race, hit point, or what ever!
